1. Report should be named in a way that would identify the problem at the first sight.
You have to write what’s the problem about in square brackets (which zone/area, vocation, etc.).
For example: [Elder Druid] 2M Spell isn't working, [Bridge - Lever broken] Lever to open the 2nd door on bridge is broken, [Automated Events] The portal is broken.

2. Every bug has to be described thoroughly. “Quest X doesn’t work” is simply not enough. You have to write what exactly is happening and what should happen.

3. Every bug should be reported with the following pattern:

-Decription:
-How it currently works:
-How it should work:

4. To make things get fixed faster, you should write the steps to reproduce said bug under “Steps to Reproduce”.

5. “Additional Information” section should contain IDs of every spell, item, game objects, etc. You may ask a staff member if needed.

6. Reports that do not meet requirements listed above can be closed without further investigation.
